# Adventure-Works-Report

### The Situation:
<p>I have just been hired as a Business Analyst by Adventure Works, a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipement and accessories.</p>

### The Brief:
<p>The management team needs a way to track KPIs ( sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.</p>
<p>All I have been given is a folder of raw csv files, which contain onformation about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.</p>

### The Objective:
<p>Use Power BI Desktop to:</p>
<p>1. Connect and transfrom the raw data.</p>
<p>2. Build a relational data model.</p>
<p>3. Create calculated columns and measures with DAX.</p>
<p>4. Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.</p>


### Please find Images in the repository to view the dashboard and an insights report of the same.
